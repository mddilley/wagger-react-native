# Wagger üê∂

Bring dogs together time and time again. Users can sign up to add their dogs, create dog playdates, and join playdates created by others.

This project started as a Ruby on Rails and JavaScript web application that I built a couple of years ago. After moving deeper into the React ecosystem, I decided to reboot the idea as way to learn React Native.

What can I say? I love dogs!

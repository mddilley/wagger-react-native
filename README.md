# Wagger üê∂

Bring your dogs together time and time again through this application. Users can sign up to add their dogs, create playdates for their dogs, or join other playdates created by other users.

This project started as a Ruby on Rails and JavaScript web application that I built a couple of years ago. After moving deeper into the React ecosystem, I decided to reboot the idea as way to learn React Native. What can I say? I love dogs!

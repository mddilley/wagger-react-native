# Wagger

This is the React Native front end for Wagger.

## Development workflow

To develop this app, I used both Expo and Xcode to preview and test updates both in macOS and on an iPhone. Expo provides an awesome experience that allows rapid feedback on code changes in a local environment, and the QR code scan feature in Expo paired with the iPhone app give the satisfaction of seeing your code live on a real device quickly.
